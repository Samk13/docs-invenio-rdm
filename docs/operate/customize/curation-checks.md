# Curation checks

_Introduced in InvenioRDM v13_

!!! warning
    This feature currently lacks a user-friendly interface for easy configuration and require manual setup.

> For the mental model of how checks are structured conceptually, refer to the [Maintain and Develop](../../maintenance/architecture/curation.md) documentation.

This is an example of the curation checks enabled in Zenodo:

## Enabling checks

To enable checks, you need to set the following configuration in your `invenio.cfg` file:

```python
# Hook into community request actions
from invenio_rdm_records.checks import requests as checks_requests
RDM_COMMUNITY_SUBMISSION_REQUEST_CLS = checks_requests.CommunitySubmission
RDM_COMMUNITY_INCLUSION_REQUEST_CLS = checks_requests.CommunityInclusion

# Enable the feature flag
CHECKS_ENABLED = True
```

## Configuring checks

Checks are added to a community like so:

```python
from invenio_checks.models import CheckConfig, Severity

check_config = CheckConfig(
    community_id=<community-uuid>,
    check_id="metadata",
    params={ ... },
    severity=Severity.INFO,
    enabled=True,
)
db.session.add(check_config)
db.session.commit()
```

To run the checks, submit a draft or record to a community and open the corresponding request.
